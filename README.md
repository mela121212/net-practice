# Net Practice

## Description
Net Practice is a project designed to provide a hands-on understanding of fundamental networking concepts. The main objective of the project is to help students grasp how computer networks function by working through practical exercises in simulated scenarios. The project focuses particularly on TCP/IP addressing, subnet masks, gateways, routers, switches, and the OSI model.

Through the training interface, students will encounter progressively challenging networking tasks that require application of theoretical knowledge to solve. By the end of the project, students are expected to have a strong foundational understanding of networking concepts and the ability to apply them in practical use cases.

## Instructions

### Launching the Training Interface
The Net Practice training interface is a web-based application designed to test and improve your networking skills.

1. Locate the `index.html` file at the root of the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice. A modern browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox) is recommended for optimal compatibility.
3. Navigate through the levels by completing each task in sequence.

### Exporting Configurations
After successfully solving a task in the interface:
1. Click the **Export Configuration** option within the interface.
2. Save the generated configuration file locally. Ensure that the file corresponds to the level you just completed.

### Submission Guidelines
To successfully complete this project, your submission must meet the following requirements:
1. Export 10 configuration files—one for each level of the training interface.
2. Place all exported configuration files in the root directory of this repository, ensuring they are correctly labeled (e.g., `Level1.cfg`, `Level2.cfg`, etc.).
3. Double-check that all configuration files are valid and functional when loaded back into the interface.

## Resources

### Networking Concepts
This project focuses on studying the following critical networking topics:
- **TCP/IP Addressing**: Understanding how devices communicate over a network using IP addresses.
- **Subnet Masks**: Dividing a network into smaller sub-networks for better efficiency and security.
- **Default Gateway**: Configuring a device to communicate with devices outside its local network.
- **Routers and Switches**: Exploring the roles of different hardware in network communication.
- **OSI Layers**: Understanding the seven layers of the OSI model and their functions in data transmission.

### AI Usage
The following elements of the project were supported by AI tools:
- Drafting and refining the structure and content of this `README.md` file.
- Generating detailed explanations for networking topics and the instructions for the training interface.
- Gathering a curated list of references to provide additional learning material.

## Additional Information
### Example Configurations
It is recommended to document specific examples of configurations for each level in this repository. The examples should:
- Demonstrate your approach to completing networking tasks at different levels.
- Include commentary on challenges, mistakes, and lessons learned.

For any further clarification or guidance on the project, refer to the official project guidelines or contact relevant advisors from the 42 staff. Ensure your final submission is well-organized and adheres to these instructions for proper evaluation.
